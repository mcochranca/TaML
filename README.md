# Theory aware Machine Learning (TaML)

This repository supports the following manuscript

Debra J. Audus, Austin McDannald, and Brian DeCost, "Leveraging Theory for Enhanced Machine Learning"  *ACS Macro Letters* **2022** *11* (9), 1117-1122 DOI: [10.1021/acsmacrolett.2c00369](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsmacrolett.2c00369),

which explores methods for incorporating imperfect theory into machine learning for improved prediction and explainability. Specifically, it focuses on the case study of the dimensions of a polymer chain, in this case the radius of gyration, in different solvent qualities. For machine learning models, three models are considered: Gaussian Process Regression with heteroscedastic noise, Gaussian Process Regression with homoscedastic noise and Random Forest. Of the three models, we encourage use of Gaussian Process Regression with heteroscedastic noise as it provides accurate uncertainty estimates.

Gaussian Process Regression with heteroscedastic noise relies on the [GPFlow](https://www.gpflow.org/) python package. However, since heteroscedastic noise is not natively implemented, we implement a derived class to add this functionality (see `taml/GPRhetero.py`). Gaussian Process Regression with homoscedastic noise is implemented natively with GPFlow. Random Forest is implemented using [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

The repository is intended for the following use cases:

- Illustrate key ideas from the manuscript including incorporating theory and using Gaussian Process Regression with heteroscedastic noise (see `notebooks/MethodComparison_GPR_HeteroscedasticNoise` and the companion notebook without heteroscedastic noise `notebooks/MethodComparison_GPR_HomoscedasticNoise`
- Provide code for Gaussian Process Regression with heteroscedastic noise (which can be used after installation with `from taml.GPRhetero import GPRhetero`).
- Reproduce figures from our manuscript (see `notebooks` folder)
- Allow for full reproducibility of the data in the manuscript

## Running the code

All code is written in Python and requires Python >= 3.7. It can be used on any operating system. Other requirements are listed in `requirements.txt`.

If you are only interested in running the Jupyter Notebooks in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), you can skip ahead to [Notebooks](#Notebooks).

First clone the code via

```bash
git clone https://github.com/usnistgov/TaML.git
```

and navigate to the directory where the repository lives

```bash
cd TaML
```

Next, one needs to create a virtual environment. This can be done using Python virtual environments or with Anaconda. Both options are listed below.

### Create a Python virtual environment (option 1)

First, make sure you are using Python 3.7 or later.

```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

where `env` is the location of the virtual environment

Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Create a virtual environment with Anaconda (option 2)

First, install [conda](https://www.anaconda.com).

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

If you are using conda>=4.6, activate the virtual environment via

```bash
conda activate TaML
```

Otherwise, see the [conda docs](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)

GPFlow 2.2.1 is not available on conda channels and must be installed via pip

```bash
pip install gpflow==2.2.1
```

### Install the TaML package

For users who wish to use the source code or import functions, the TaML package can be installed via

```bash
pip install .
```

## Notebooks

Included notebooks include `DataVisualization` for visualizing the input data used for machine learning, `MethodComparison_GPR_HeteroscedasticNoise` for comparing different methods for incorporating theory into machine learning using Gaussian Process Regression with heteroscedastic noise, `MethodComparison_GPR_HomoscedasticNoise` for comparing different methods for incorporating theory into machine learning using Gaussian Process Regression with homoscedastic noise, and `ViewResults` for plotting the relative performance of different methods for incorporating theory into machine learning for three different machine learning models.

### Running notebooks locally (option 1)

For users interested in testing ideas, we recommend focusing on the `MethodComparison_GPR_HeteroscedasticNoise` notebook as it explores the different methods and takes into account the known uncertainties in the input data. 

If you cloned the repository, the Jupyter notebooks can by run by navigating to the notebook folder and using the command

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Running notebooks in Google Colab (option 2)

If you are interested in running one or more notebooks in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), first click on the relevant link below. Note that these links were generated by navigating to the notebook of interest on the TaML GitHub page, for example, `https://github.com/usnistgov/TaML/blob/main/notebooks/MethodComparison_GPR_HeteroscedasticNoise.ipynb` and then replace `github.com` with `githubtocolab.com`.

- [MethodComparison_GPR_HeteroscedasticNoise](https://githubtocolab.com/usnistgov/TaML/blob/main/notebooks/MethodComparison_GPR_HeteroscedasticNoise.ipynb)
- [MethodComparison_GPR_HomoscedasticNoise](https://githubtocolab.com/usnistgov/TaML/blob/main/notebooks/MethodComparison_GPR_HomoscedasticNoise.ipynb)
- [DataVisualization](https://githubtocolab.com/usnistgov/TaML/blob/main/notebooks/DataVisualization.ipynb)
- [ViewResults](https://githubtocolab.com/usnistgov/TaML/blob/main/notebooks/ViewResults.ipynb)

This should open the notebook in Google Colab. For the `DataVisualization` and `ViewResults` notebooks, all dependencies are likely available and you should be able to directly run them. For the `MethodComparison_GPR_HeteroscedasticNoise` and `MethodComparison_GPR_HomoscedasticNoise` notebooks, you must install GPFlow. This can be accomplished by 

(1) uncommenting out the code block

```bash
!pip install gpflow==2.2.1
```

(2) executing the code block

(3) restarting the run time environment (there should be a button at the bottom of the output for that code block).

Then you can run the notebook as normal.

## Source code

The source code (see the `taml` folder) compares a variety of methods for incorporating theory into machine learning for three different machine learning models: Gaussian Process Regression with heteroscedastic noise, Gaussian Process Regression with homoscedastic noise and Random Forest. The output of the files can be plotted by modifying the notebook title `ViewResults` such that the data files are pulled from a local run as opposed to the stored data.

To run the source code

```bash
python3 -m taml
```
